          <p>
            I tried out the pomodoro technique and mindfulness.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was interested in the pomodoro technique. It was a new idea to me but seems quite obvious once you hear it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I find mindfulness works for me, though I haven't consciously brought it to a study environment before.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would like to experiment more with the pomodoro technique. I didn't have much time this week but plan to try it out properly next week. I'm also interested in trying tiny habits, though I need to think about what habits I would like to form.
