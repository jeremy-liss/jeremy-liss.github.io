      I tried out the pomodoro technique and mindfulness.

      I was interested in the pomodoro technique. It was a new idea to me but seems quite obvious once you hear it.

      I find mindfulness works for me, though I haven't consciuslly brought to a study environment before.

      I would like to expirement more with the pomodoro technique. I'm also intersted in trying tiny habits, though I need to think about what habits I would like to form.
