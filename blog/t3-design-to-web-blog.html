          <h3>Responsive sites</h3>
          <p>
            A responsive site displays differently depending on the kind of device that is being used to access it. You can have a different design which is optimised to look best for each device, and to work better depending on whether the user will be interacting with a mouse or swiping.
          </p>

          <h3>Mobile first design</h3>
          <p>
            Mobile first design means beginning with the design most optimised for mobile and then making exceptions for larger devices. This is because sites for larger devices usually have more data and larger images to load - designing mobile first means that mobiles won't need to load up all this information which they would if it was designed desktop first.
          </p>

          <h3>Frameworks</h3>
          <p>
            A framework is a template of CSS, HTML or js files which can be used to standardise code and solve common problems such as browser compatibility and responsiveness. They provide a common structure so that it's not necessary for developers to write it all out themselves.

            <ul>
              <h5>Pros</h5>
              <li>Standardised code</li>
              <li>Neat and tidy code</li>
              <li>Automatic browser compatibility</li>
              <li>Responsive</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <h5>Cons</h5>
              <li>Less control</li>
              <li>Unused code</li>
              <li>Less learning through doing it yourself</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
            A wireframe is a simple sketch of the layout of a website, drawn up in the early stages of the design process. It's a bit like a blueprint for a house.
          </p>
          <p>
            The thing I found most difficult to implement was getting the alignment I wanted, I found that the different sized columns didn't necessarily align the content within them to other elements on the page. I would also liked to have centred all the content on the mobile site but wasn't sure how to achieve that.
