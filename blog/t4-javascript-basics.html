          <h3>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h3>
          <p>
            HTML is the foundation of a webpage. It creates the structure with things like headings, paragraphs and lists. CSS is then used to style these foundations with things like colours, fonts, backgrounds and they way they are arranged on the page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Javascript is different in that it creates ways of interacting with the page. It can be used to perform functions such as equations, check user inputs for things like spelling, and update webpages in realtime without the need for the page to be refreshed.
          </p>
          <h3>Control Flow & Loops</h3>
          <p>
          Control flow is a way arranging the order in which javascript statements are executed. Loops are a useful way of controlling this order. The repeat a piece of code until some preset limit is reached. For example, if you wanted to write code a code that helped someone get dressed, you might create a loop that adds one item of clothing each time it runs. If you only want your person to wear four items of clothing, you would set the loop to keep running up until the person has four items of clothing on. Then the loop would stop and the next part of the code would run (maybe going into the bathroom).
        </p>
        <h3>Accessing Objects & Arrays</h3>
        <p>
          Arrays are a collection of elements stored together and assigned to one variable. They can store anything, such as strings and numbers. Each piece of data in an array is indexed and can be accessed by calling the array name and the index number of the data. The index begins at 0, so the first item in an array has the index number 0, the second has 1 etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data inside objects has a 'property' and a 'value'. For example, an object called 'jeremy', might have the property 'firstName' and that property might have the value 'Jeremy'. To access the data you call the name of the object + the property. This can be done with dot notation or bracket notation. For example 'jeremy.firstName' or 'jeremy["firstName"]' would return the vale 'Jeremy'.
        </p>
        <h3>Javascript functions</h3>
        <p>
          A javascript function is a block of code which performs a task (for example adding five to a given value) and is assigned to a variable. They are useful because it means that instead of writing out the code each time you want to perform the task, you can just call the variable.
