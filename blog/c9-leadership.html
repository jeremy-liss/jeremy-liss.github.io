          <h3>Compassionate Leadership</h3>
          <p>
            I think I have been fortunate enough to work in situations were there was compassionate leadership. It definitely lead to a sense that I was an important part of the organisation, and staff tended to care about their work and each other.
          </p>
          <h3>Multiplying Goodness</h3>
          <p>
            I found the multiplying goodness meditation enjoyable. I found it interesting that even though it was just imagination based you really got a sense of the 'goodness' and that it was multiplying.
          </p>
          <h3>Tonglen</h3>
          <p>
            I had a similar experience with the Tonglen meditation. I didn't find it as overwhelming as he suggested some people had, but I also found it a bit difficult to fully experience a negative situation.
          </p>
          <h3>SCARF</h3>
          <p>
            I certainly recognised the Status and Certainty elements of the SCARF model in relation to phase 0. I do sometimes find myself trying to figure out where I rank amongst the students, and I also recognise the feeling that comes with not knowing something that I feel I'm supposed to. I imagine these will be even more present during bootcamp as well as relatedness, at least to start with.
          </p>
          <h3>Difficult Conversations</h3>
          <p>
            I haven't had a chance to have a difficult conversation yet, but I found it really interesting to read about as I definitely have a fear of difficult conversations. I will definitely re-read that section next time.
