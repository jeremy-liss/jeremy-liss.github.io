          <h3>Insight/trust</h3>
          <p>
            I haven't yet had the chance to try the techniques but found it fascinating and can see how big a difference it would make to work culture to begin from a place of trust.
          </p>
          <h3>Empathic Listening</h3>
          <p>
            I did the informal empathic listening exercise. I didn't feel it was appropriate to let the other person know I was doing it but I found that I was able to pick up on their feelings and respond in what felt like a more helpful way.
          </p>
          <h3>Loving Kindness</h3>
          <p>
            I found the loving kindness meditation quite enjoyable, and as he he says in the book, my main feeling during it was happiness. I like the idea of making it a daily practice.
          </p>
          <h3>Political Awareness Exercise</h3>
          <p>
            A situation I recall is a time when I was with some friends. Two of us were joking about something and having a good time. The other friend interjected to tell us that were weren't funny, which felt quite hurtful. Looking at it from her side I can see that were communicating in a way that excluded her and she felt must have felt that we were intentionally leaving her out.
