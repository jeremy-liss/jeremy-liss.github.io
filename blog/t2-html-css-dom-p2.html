          <h3>What is Grid Based Design?</h3>

          <p>
            Grid based design splits a webpage up into rows and columns. This makes it easier to place elements on the page and to rearrange them later. If the page is split into 12 columns for example, you can then create elements that take up 1 column, 3 columns, 9 columns etc. You can use flexbox to make the elements sit next to one another rather than on top of each other.
          </p>

          <h3>Responsive Webpages</h3>

          <p>
            Responsive webpages display differently depending on the resolution of the screen you are using. Therefore you can can make the same page load up differently to best suit the device it's being viewed on - desktop, mobile or tablet.
          </p>

          <h3>Semantic Structure</h3>

          <p>
            Semantic structure uses tags which are easily understandable - h1 h2 h3 for headings, p for paragraph etc. These can be used to make particular elements stand out.
          </p>

          <h3>Other Points</h3>

          <p>
            I found it interesting and enjoyable (though a bit frustrating) to learn and practice how a developer writes code to match a design brief.
