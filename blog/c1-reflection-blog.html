        <p>
          I am quite inspired by the EDA/DBC approach. I enjoyed Sheeref's explenation of the kitchen rather than the restaurant. It sounds as though it is really about everybody pitching in and creating something together, rather than just a service or product we have paid for.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm definetley willing and excited to engage with this type of culture. It will be quite a new type of enviroment for me though and I think it may take me a bit of practice to get used to speaking up and sharing my ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think my expectations have shifted a bit - I get the sense now that everybody is giving/teaching as well as learning/recieving.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm definetly very nervous! I hope I can take advantage of this unique experience - I think it could be quite life changing.
