          <p>
            In chapter one of this book I learnt that emotional intelligence can be more imprtant in a workplace than IQ. It can have a big effect on your worklife and overall happiness. I learnt that the brain is trainable and actually changes shape (called neuroplasticity). This is the case for London cabbies who have gained 'the knowledge' and for people who have meditated for a long time, and whose amagdyla glands function differently to other people's.

            I already have an established mindfulness practice and try to start the day with 20 minutes or so. I still find I need to reminded all the time though, and basic instruction like this is always useful.
