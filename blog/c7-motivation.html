          <h3>Pleasure, Passion and Purpose</h3>
          <p>
            Pleasure, passion and purpose refers to the three kinds of happiness we can experience. Pleasure is the short lived kind of happiness that comes from pleasurable experiences. Passion is the happiness we get from being engaged in an activity that we are passionate about, the kind where we might lose our sense of time. This is longer lasting than pleasure. Purpose is the kind of happiness we get from being part of something larger than ourselves and which gives meaning to our lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Generally we spend our time seeking after pleasure and occasionally engaging in purpose. However, research suggests if start by focusing on purpose our lives will become much richer and we may be able to find much more rewarding work.
          </p>
          <h3>Core Values and Higher Purpose</h3>
          <p>
            My core values come from the belief that all life is interconnected, I therefore aim to lead a life that avoids causing harm and strives to be of assistance.
          </p>
          <h3>Resilience</h3>
          <p>
            I found the resilience exercise interesting. I think learning to be more accepting of failure is a very difficult but very life changing experience and something I have been working on. I still can find it very easy to try and push away the feelings that come with failure but realise it's something I will need to get used to in the coming weeks.
