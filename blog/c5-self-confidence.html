          <h3>Minfulness and Self-Awareness</h3>
          <p>
            According to Chade-Meng Tan in <i>Search Inside Yourself</i>, mindfulness and self-awareness are essentially the same thing. He quotes Daniel Goleman as saying “Self-awareness … is a neutral mode that maintains self-reflectiveness even in the midst of turbulent emotions.” And Jon Kabat-Zin as saying “Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally."

            I tried the body scan meditation and really enjoyed it. I think practicing the same style of meditation for a long time can get a bit same-y and doing the body scan felt really fresh and reminded me of trying mindfulness meditation for the first time. Adding in the pleasant memory/emotion was really enjoyable. Having read the research around the benefits of journaling, I plan to also try that out.

            While the 'my emotions are not me' section wasn't new to me, it's still always refreshing to hear it again and especially when it is put it in a new way. It's easy to forget and fall back into getting caught up in believing the clouds are the sky.
