          <h3>Process over product</h3>
          <p>
            Having the 'process over product' concept in mind while I was working on my blog I think meant I was better able to notice if I was spending too long trying to perfect something, and meant I could move on and try the next thing. I also tried a few things that seemed like they would be too hard and might not work which I probably wouldn't have done if I was focused on making something that looked and worked well.

          <h3>Meditation</h3>
            <p>
              I have been meditating for a few years now and find it really beneficial, so I think it's really cool that is part of the curriculum at EDA.

              I was surprised to hear that mindfulness increases immunity!

              I really appreciated the emphasis on finding a way of practicing that works for you, and the reminder that there's no such thing as a bad meditation session.

              I always feel a get a lot from reading beginners introductions to meditation. There's often some little tip or different way of phrasing things that reminds me that it's very simple at its heart.
