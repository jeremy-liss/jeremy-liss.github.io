          I haven't yet had chance to try the mindfulness conversation as I have just read the chapter and need to get this blog up on Sunday night. I thought it sounded very intriguing and look forward to practicing it.

            I think I will try the 'one breath a day' technique to try and maintain my practice. I do tend to think of meditation as needing to be 25 minutes and somewhat formal, so I do put it off I feel like I don't have the time.
          </p>

            I thought the circuit training idea was interesting and I might try it out. I generally just do focused rather than open meditation, so I'm interested to see what doing both will be like.
